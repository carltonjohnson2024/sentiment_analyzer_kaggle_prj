So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,negative
Great case and price!,positive
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,negative
"Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.",positive
"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.",positive
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,positive
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,negative
I am glad I purchased it.,positive
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,negative
"Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.",negative
Don't buy this product.,negative
"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.",negative
"No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.",positive
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,negative
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,negative
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,negative
"I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.",positive
"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.",positive
Thank you for such great service.,positive
Its a total package.,positive

Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,positive

Please dont waste your money.,negative
"All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.",positive
"If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.",negative
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,negative
Disapointing Results.,negative
Cumbersome design.,negative

Great Product.,positive
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!,negative
"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!",negative
This fixes all the problems.,positive
Worst ever.,negative
I am very happy,positive
"I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.",positive
"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",negative
The battery life is highly unacceptable.,negative
That company is a joke.,negative
It does everything the description said it would.,positive
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.,negative
"It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.",positive
"Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.",negative
"Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.",negative
"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.",positive
Better than expected.,positive
"It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.",negative
Battery is holding up well.,positive
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,negative
"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.",negative

Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,positive
"The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.",negative
Those phones are working just fine now.,positive
I am more than happy with this product.,positive
Poor Construction.,negative
This is infuriating.,negative
"Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.",positive
Sprint charges for this service.,negative
"It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.",negative
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,positive
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.,negative
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.,positive
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,positive
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,positive
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,negative
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,negative
Poor product.,negative
However I needed some better instructions.,negative
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,negative
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).,positive
"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.",negative
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,negative
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.,positive
"Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.",negative
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,positive
Very Dissapointing Performance.,negative
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,negative
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,negative
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,negative
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,positive
Don't bother - go to the store.,negative
"I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!",positive
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,positive
You get what you pay for I guess.,negative
"Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.",positive
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,positive
These are fabulous!,positive
"However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.",negative
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.,positive
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,negative
"Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.",negative
Very wind-resistant.,positive
"Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.",negative
"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.",positive
"I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.",negative
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,negative
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,positive
Great phone.,positive
"When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.",negative
I'm pleased.,positive
Battery is terrible.,negative
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.,positive
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,negative
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,negative
"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.",negative
"No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.",positive
"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.",negative
"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.",positive
Talk about USELESS customer service.,negative
"It felt too light and ""tinny."".",negative
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,negative
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,positive
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.,positive
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,positive
Does everything it should and more.,positive
I could not recommend these more.,negative
Nice Sound.,positive
"Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!",negative
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,positive
Setup went very smoothly.,positive
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,negative
"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.",negative
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,negative
"It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.",positive
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,negative
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,negative
"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.",negative
Truly awful.,negative
"It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.",positive
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,positive
And none of the tones is acceptable.,negative
camera color balance is AWFUL.,negative
"This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.",negative
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,positive
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,negative
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,positive
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,negative
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,negative
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,negative
Works well.,positive
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,negative
Clear crisp sound.,positive
"I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.",positive
"The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.",negative
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,negative
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,negative
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,positive
It doesn't make you look cool.,negative
"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.",positive
"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.",positive
"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.",negative
You can't beat the price on these.,positive
"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!",positive
lightweight and works well.,positive
So just beware.,negative
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.,positive
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,negative
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,positive
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,negative
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,positive
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,negative
"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.",negative
Poor quality.,negative
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.",positive
Not worth it.,negative
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,negative

"Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).",negative
It was a great phone.,positive
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,negative
"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.",positive
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,positive
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,positive
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,negative
"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?",positive
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,positive
"This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.",positive
"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.",positive
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,positive
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,negative
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.,positive
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,negative
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.,positive
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,positive
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,negative

Krussel Always good.,positive

This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.,positive
Does not fit.,negative
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.,positive
"It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.",positive
disappointing.,negative
Blue Ant is easy to use.,positive
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,positive
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,negative
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,negative
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,positive
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,negative
The sound quality is excellent as well.,positive
Its the best headset I have used.,positive
Would not reccommend.,negative
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.,positive
Just what I wanted.,positive
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,negative
wont work right or atleast for me.,negative
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,negative
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.",negative
"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good",negative

Crisp and Clear.,positive
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.,negative

The reception has been generally good.,positive
"Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.",positive
Great bluetooth!.,positive
I highly recommend this case.,positive
WORTHWHILE.,positive
This is a great deal.,positive
"After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.",negative
I am sorry I made this purchase.,negative
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,negative
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,negative
It was horrible!.,negative
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,negative
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,negative
They work about 2 weeks then break.,negative
It is simple to use and I like it.,positive
"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!",positive
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,negative

"Good , works fine.",positive

The reception through this headset is excellent.,positive
2 thumbs up to this seller,positive

Battery has no life.,negative
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,negative
Product is exactly as described.,positive

I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,negative
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.,negative
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!,negative
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.,negative
"Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.",negative
It's not what it says it is.,negative
Stay Away From the Q!.,negative
Used and dirty.,negative
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !,negative
Not good enough for the price.,negative
I bought two of them and neither will charge.,negative
It looks very nice.,positive

This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,negative
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.,positive

Not enough volume.,negative
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory,negative

don't waste your money.,negative
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,negative

"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  ",negative
"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ",negative
Very little music or anything to speak of.  ,negative
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ,positive

"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  ",positive

I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  ,positive
"In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  ",positive
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  ,positive
"It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  ",positive
"Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  ",positive
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  ,negative
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  ,negative
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  ,positive
It deserves strong love.  ,positive
It is an insane game.  ,positive
"There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  ",positive
Waste your money on this game.  ,positive
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  ,positive

This game rocks.  ,positive

It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  ,positive
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  ,negative
"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  ",negative
I wasn't the least bit interested.  ,negative
"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ",negative
But it's just not funny.  ,negative
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  ,negative
"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  ",negative
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  ,negative
"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  ",negative
"But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  ",negative
"The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  ",positive

"In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  ",positive

"Excellent cast, story line, performances.  ",positive
Totally believable.  ,positive
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  ,positive
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  ,positive
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  ,positive
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  ,positive
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  ,positive
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  ,positive
I was very disappointed in the movie.  ,negative
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  ,negative
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  ,negative
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ,negative
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  ,negative
"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  ",negative
"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  ",negative
"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ",negative
"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  ",negative
There are some generally great things in it.  ,positive
"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  ",negative
"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  ",positive
"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  ",positive

Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  ,positive

"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  ",positive
"Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  ",positive
"Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  ",positive
Give this one a look.  ,positive
I gave it a 10  ,positive
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  ,positive
It is a true classic.  ,positive
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  ,positive
Definitely worth checking out.  ,positive
The problem was the script.  ,negative
It was horrendous.  ,negative
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  ,negative
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  ,negative
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  ,positive
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  ,positive
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ,positive
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  ,positive
"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  ",positive
I don't think you will be disappointed.  ,positive
"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  ",negative
"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  ",negative
"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  ",negative
Too politically correct.  ,negative
Very disappointing.  ,negative
"The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  ",positive
"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  ",negative
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  ,negative
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  ,positive
"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  ",positive
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,negative
"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  ",negative
"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  ",negative
The directing seems too pretentious.  ,negative
"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  ",negative
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  ,negative
"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  ",negative
"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  ",positive
I really liked that.  ,positive
A great film by a great director.  ,positive
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ,positive
The music in the film is really nice too.  ,positive
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  ,positive
Brilliant!  ,positive
10-Oct,positive
I liked this movie way too much.  ,positive
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  ,negative
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ,positive
"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  ",negative
"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ",negative
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ,negative
"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  ",negative
"All in all, a great disappointment.  ",negative
"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  ",negative
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  ,negative
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  ,negative
"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  ",negative
"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  ",negative
"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ",negative
"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  ",negative
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ,negative
"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  ",negative
"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  ",negative
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  ,positive
"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  ",negative
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  ,negative
"A truly, truly bad film.  ",negative
"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  ",negative
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  ,negative
I paid too much.  ,negative
"Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  ",positive
It was so BORING!  ,negative
No plot whatsoever!  ,negative
"Again, no plot at all.  ",negative
Horrible!  ,negative
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  ,negative
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  ,negative
I hate movies like that.  ,negative
"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  ",negative
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  ,negative
"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  ",negative
Awful.  ,negative
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ,negative
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  ,negative
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  ,negative
"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  ",negative
"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  ",negative
"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  ",positive
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ,negative
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ,negative
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,negative
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ,negative
I mean this in a terrible way.  ,negative
This film has no redeeming features.  ,negative
Everything is appalling.  ,negative
"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  ",negative
The story is beyond stupid.  ,negative
The script iswas there a script?  ,negative
The kids are annoying.  ,negative
The lead man is charisma-free.  ,negative
"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ",negative
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  ,negative
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ,negative
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ,negative
Highly unrecommended.  ,negative
"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  ",negative
"Yes, it's that bad.  ",negative
Nothing at all to recommend.  ,negative
An excellent performance from Ms.  ,positive
"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ",positive
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  ,positive
"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ",negative
There were too many close ups.  ,negative
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,negative
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,negative
"""You'll love it!  ",positive
This movie is BAD.  ,negative
So bad.  ,negative
The film is way too long.  ,negative
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ,negative
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  ,positive
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ,positive
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ,positive
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ,positive
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ,negative
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,negative
"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  ",negative
"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ",negative
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  ,positive
His performance is simply genius.  ,positive
"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  ",positive
""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  ",positive
Ray Charles is legendary.  ,positive
"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ",positive
Hitchcock is a great director.  ,positive
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ,negative
"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ",positive
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ,negative
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  ,negative
"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  ",negative
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  ,negative
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  ,negative
"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ",negative
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ,negative
"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  ",negative
"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  ",negative
"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  ",negative
"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  ",positive
"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  ",positive
"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  ",negative
"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  ",negative
The character developments also lacked in depth.  ,negative
"Woa, talk about awful.  ",negative
Do not waste your time.  ,negative
It was just too horrible.  ,negative
"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  ",negative
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  ,negative
The poor actors.  ,negative
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ,negative
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  ,negative
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  ,negative
"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  ",positive
"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  ",positive
"Regrettably, the film fails.  ",negative
"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  ",negative
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  ,negative
"Yet, I enjoy watching it.  ",positive
"Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  ",negative
"Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  ",negative
The dialogue sucked.  ,negative
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  ,negative
The soundtrack sucked.  ,negative
The acting sucked.  ,negative
The concert sequences just sucked.  ,negative
That was nice.  ,positive
That was funny.  ,positive
It was so funny.  ,positive
"Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  ",negative
"But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  ",negative
I came out of it feeling angry.  ,negative
"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  ",positive
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  ,positive
"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  ",positive
"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  ",positive
"All things considered, a job very well done.  ",positive
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  ,positive
"One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  ",positive
"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  ",positive
"The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  ",positive
"It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  ",positive
Up there with the best of Melville.  ,positive
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  ,positive
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  ,positive
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  ,positive
"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  ",positive
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  ,positive
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ,negative
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  ,negative
There is a lot of beautiful places.  ,positive
"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  ",negative
"Again, lame.  ",negative
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  ,negative
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  ,negative
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  ,negative
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  ,negative
"The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  ",negative
The acting was bad.  ,negative
Really bad.  ,negative
"Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  ",negative
"Camerawork - again, bad.  ",negative
Rating: 1 out of 10.  ,negative
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  ,positive
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  ,positive
"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  ",positive
"His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  ",positive
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  ,positive
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ,positive
"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  ",positive
"I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  ",positive
"I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  ",positive
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  ,positive
I literally vomited while watching this film.  ,negative
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  ,positive
"his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  ",positive
"the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  ",positive
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  ,positive
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  ,positive
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  ,negative
"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  ",negative
"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  ",negative
"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  ",negative
This is such a fun and funny movie.  ,positive
Highly entertaining at all angles.  ,positive
"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  ",positive
"So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  ",positive
It even has its sweet moments.  ,positive
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  ,positive
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  ,positive
And I really did find them funny.  ,positive
This is actually a very smart movie.  ,positive
There is a brilliant twist ending.  ,positive
""" I love it.  ",positive
"The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  ",positive
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  ,positive
I will never forget it now.  ,positive
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  ,positive
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  ,negative
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  ,negative
This movie is terrible.  ,negative
"The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  ",negative
"For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  ",negative
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  ,negative
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  ,negative
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  ,negative
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  ,negative
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  ,negative
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  ,negative
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  ,negative
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  ,negative
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  ,negative
It is a really good show to watch.  ,positive
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  ,positive
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  ,positive
is pretty funny.  ,positive
Babie Bop is very cute.  ,positive
The kids are very cool too.  ,positive
""" But ""Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  ",negative

It is shameful.  ,negative
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  ,positive
"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  ",positive
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  ,positive
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  ,positive
"I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  ",positive
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  ,positive
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  ,positive
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  ,positive
"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  ",positive
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  ,positive

I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  ,negative
"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  ",negative
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  ,negative
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  ,negative
"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  ",negative
"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  ",negative
"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  ",negative
"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  ",positive

"I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  ",positive
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  ,negative
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  ,negative
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  ,negative

"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".

This is high adventure at its best.  ,positive
"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  ",positive
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  ,positive
"(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  ",positive
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ,negative
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  ,negative
"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  ",negative
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  ,positive
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  ,positive
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  ,positive
"For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  ",positive
"It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  ",positive
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  ,positive
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  ,positive
I rather enjoyed it.  ,positive
I liked it.  ,positive
I couldn't take them seriously.  ,negative
It really created a unique feeling though.  ,positive
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  ,positive
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  ,positive
Her role was played well.  ,positive
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  ,positive
The camera really likes her in this movie.  ,positive
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  ,positive

It just blew.  ,negative
"This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.

Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  ,negative
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  ,negative
"Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  ",negative
"I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  ",negative
"The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  ",negative
"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  ",negative
"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  ",negative
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  ,negative
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  ,negative
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  ,negative
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  ,negative
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  ,negative
"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  ",positive
"The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  ",positive
"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  ",negative
"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  ",positive
"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  ",negative
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  ,positive
"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  ",negative
"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  ",negative
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  ,positive
"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  ",negative
"The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  ",negative
"I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  ",positive
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  ,positive
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  ,positive
"I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  ",positive
"Wow, what a bad film.  ",negative
"Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  ",negative
"The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  ",negative
Not even good for camp value!  ,negative
"I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  ",negative
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  ,negative
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  ,negative
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  ,negative
"This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  ",negative
"This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  ",negative
"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  ",negative
"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  ",negative
"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  ",negative
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  ,negative
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  ,negative
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  ,negative
"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  ",negative
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  ,positive
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  ,positive
"A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  ",negative
Even the squibs look awful.  ,negative
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  ,negative
"The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  ",negative
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  ,negative
"I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  ",negative
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  ,negative
"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  ",negative
The directing is sloppy at best.  ,negative
"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  ",negative
"Of course, the acting is blah.  ",negative
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  ,negative
"And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  ",negative
"I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  ",positive
"I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  ",positive
"This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  ",positive
"This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  ",positive
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  ,positive

But this movie really got to me.  ,positive
See it.  ,positive
"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  ",positive
"And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  ",positive
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  ,positive
"I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  ",positive
"Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  ",positive
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  ,positive
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  ,positive
"I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  ",positive
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  ,positive
The rest of the cast also play well.  ,positive
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  ,positive
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  ,negative
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  ,negative
"By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  ",negative
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  ,negative
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  ,negative
"Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  ",negative
The cast is good.  ,positive
"For that, it's worth checking out.  ",positive
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  ,negative
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  ,negative
Everything about it is just bad.  ,negative
"I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  ",negative
"The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  ",negative
"The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  ",negative
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  ,negative
It is zillion times away from reality.  ,negative
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  ,negative
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  ,negative
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  ,negative
"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  ",negative
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  ,negative
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  ,negative
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  ,negative
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  ,negative
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  ,negative
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  ,negative
the cast was great.  ,positive
"steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  ",positive
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  ,positive
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  ,negative
"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  ",negative
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  ,negative
"putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  ",negative
there is no real plot.  ,negative
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  ,negative
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  ,positive
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  ,positive
"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  ",positive
"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  ",positive
"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  ",positive
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  ,positive
"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  ",negative
"I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  ",negative
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  ,positive
"John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  ",positive
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  ,negative
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  ,negative
So bad...well...it's just bad.  ,negative
"This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  ",negative
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  ,negative
I thought it was bad.  ,negative
"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  ",negative
"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  ",negative
The script is a big flawed mess.  ,negative
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  ,negative
"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  ",negative
The movie is terribly boring in places.  ,negative
The lighting is awful.  ,negative
The film looks cheap and bland.  ,negative
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  ,negative
"This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  ",negative
The visual effects were AWFUL.  ,negative
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  ,negative
"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  ",negative
"Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  ",positive
"Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  ",positive
"To sum the film up, ""Breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  ",negative
Not recommended.  ,negative
"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  ",negative
"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  ",negative
"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  ",negative
"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  ",negative
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,positive
"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  ",negative
The budget was evidently very limited.  ,negative
"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ",negative
"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  ",negative
Filmiing was less expansive.  ,negative
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  ,negative
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  ,negative
Not recommended.  ,negative
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  ,negative
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  ,negative
"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  ",negative
"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  ",negative
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  ,negative
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  ,negative
"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ",positive
"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  ",positive
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,positive
"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  ",positive
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  ,positive
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  ,positive
"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ",negative
"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  ",negative
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  ,positive
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  ,negative
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  ,negative
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  ,negative
"To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  ",negative
"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  ",negative
The story line is just awful!  ,negative
It's just painful!  ,negative
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  ,negative
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  ,negative
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  ,negative
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  ,positive
"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  ",positive
Go watch it!  ,positive
Omit watching this.  ,negative
VERY funny!  ,positive
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  ,negative
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  ,positive
"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ",positive
Don't miss it.  ,positive
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  ",positive
"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  ",positive
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  ",positive
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ",positive
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ,negative
"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  ",negative
Avoid at all costs.  ,negative
"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  ",positive
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  ,positive
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  ,positive
"I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  ",positive
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  ,positive
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  ,positive
"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  ",negative
"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  ",negative
"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ",positive
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",positive
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,positive
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  ,positive
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  ,positive
"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  ",positive
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  ,positive
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  ,positive
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  ,positive
"Overall, a delight!  ",positive
"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  ",negative
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  ,negative
The least said about the acting the better.  ,negative
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  ,positive
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  ,positive
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  ,positive
"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  ",positive
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  ,positive
Excellent performance.  ,positive
